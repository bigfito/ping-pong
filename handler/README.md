# Handler Module Documentation

The `handler` module is a core part of the application responsible for processing incoming requests, applying business logic, and returning appropriate responses. This module acts as an intermediary to ensure the smooth functioning and orchestration of the application's main features.

## Features

The `handler` module provides the following key functionalities:
- **Request Processing**: Handles incoming input and maps it to the relevant operations or services.
- **Error Management**: Provides a structured mechanism for handling errors and exceptions.
- **Business Workflow Integration**: Includes the necessary logic to orchestrate services and handle business use cases effectively.
- **Response Handling**: Encodes and returns responses in a standardized and efficient manner (e.g., JSON, XML).

## Structure

The structure of the `handler` module typically includes:
1. **Controllers**: Exposing endpoints for inbound communication.
2. **Handlers**: Implementing the core logic for processing requests.
3. **Validators**: Enforcing input validation rules prior to further processing.
4. **Mappers**: Transforming and adapting data objects between layers.
5. **Error Handlers**: Capturing unexpected scenarios, logging them, and responding appropriately.

## Key Components

Below are some key components that belong to the `handler` module:

### Controllers
Controllers define the publicly facing API endpoints and are annotated with Spring's `@RestController`. They delegate incoming requests to the appropriate handler for execution.

### Handlers
Handlers are responsible for orchestrating the processing logic and making calls to the service layer as needed. They act as an abstraction between the controllers and the application services.

### Validators
Input data is validated through the `@Valid` annotation (or custom validators) to ensure that requests comply with expected formats and rules before reaching the handler.

### Exception Handling
The `handler` module includes global exception handling through Spring's `@ControllerAdvice`, ensuring consistent error responses and logging for all endpoints.

## Configuration

The configuration of the `handler` module may include:
1. **Application Properties**: Endpoints and handler-specific settings can be tailored in `application.yml` or `application.properties`.
2. **Maven Configuration**: Ensure that this module is correctly included in the `pom.xml`. If other modules depend on it, their dependency should follow the correct hierarchy.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.example</groupId>
    <artifactId>handler</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

## Usage in Development

Developers can interact with the `handler` module by:
1. Writing controller tests to validate APIs exposed by the handlers.
2. Diving into the `handler` classes to customize or extend the business logic.
3. Adding mappers or validators as needed to accommodate changes in input or output formats.

## Future Enhancements

Some potential future enhancements for the module include:
- Adding caching for frequently used operations.
- Incorporating more robust logging for debugging and monitoring purposes.
- Implementing performance profiling for high-traffic endpoints.
